# Plastic-Paper-Garbage_bag_segmentation

In this project we will use image segmentation to classify and segment garbage, paper and plastic bags.
This will help us to segregate waste by classifying garbage bags which can be recycled, plastic bags which are not easily dispossable and paper bags which are easily dispossable.

**Instance Segmentation**

In this project I have used instance segmentation to segment paper, plastic and garbage bags. 
Instance segmentation is a part of semantic segmentation which is used to segmnt object belonging to same class, instance segmentation goes one step further by segmenting object of same class as well.

**YOLOV8 segmentation**
Yolov8 is latest version of SOTA (Steate-Of-The-Art) YOLO model introduced by Ultralytics which is suitable for range of computer vision tasks, including object detection, segmentation, pose estimation, classification and tracking. YOLOv8 is faster and more accurate than its previous versions.
